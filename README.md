# Introduction
In modern data-intensive environments, distributed SQL systems such as Apache Spark, Hive, and Presto are widely used to process and analyze large-scale datasets. While these systems offer powerful query capabilities, understanding the performance characteristics and optimization implications of SQL queries often requires deep technical expertise. This creates a gap between query execution and the user’s ability to interpret and improve performance, especially for data analysts, engineers, and researchers who may not be database optimization experts.

This research aims to bridge that gap by developing a rule-based natural language explanation system that analyzes SQL queries and their execution plans, and then provides human-readable suggestions and warnings. The goal is to help users quickly identify performance bottlenecks, anti-patterns, and optimization opportunities in a clear and accessible way. Unlike traditional tools or black-box AI models, this system leverages transparent and explainable rule sets tailored to common practices and pitfalls in distributed environments.

By providing intuitive feedback at both the query text and execution plan levels, this system empowers users to write more efficient SQL, reduce compute costs, and better understand how distributed systems behave under the hood. Ultimately, the project contributes to the growing need for explainability and usability in data infrastructure tools, aligning with the broader vision of making big data systems more accessible, reliable, and efficient for all users.

# Background and Motivation
In modern data-driven environments, distributed SQL engines like Apache Spark SQL and Apache Hive play a critical role in processing vast volumes of data efficiently. These engines generate complex query execution plans to optimize performance across clusters. However, the output of these execution plans—often represented in trees, stages, or operator graphs—is not easily interpretable by most data analysts, engineers, or even developers. While these tools are powerful, their usability suffers when users must manually decipher why a query is slow or inefficient.

Efforts to address this challenge typically involve post-execution performance monitoring dashboards, cost-based optimizers, or, more recently, AI-based assistants. However, these approaches either lack contextual specificity (as in generic AI models like ChatGPT), or they fail to provide understandable, rule-based explanations tied directly to the system's logic and infrastructure.

The motivation behind this research is twofold:

1) Accessibility and Transparency: Many users of distributed SQL systems do not have deep knowledge of internal query optimization strategies. By translating query execution details into natural language, we democratize access to performance tuning insights and empower users to write more efficient queries.

2) Explainability in Automation: As data platforms move towards more autonomous and self-optimizing systems, there's a growing demand for transparent explanations of system behavior. Rule-based natural language feedback ensures that users can trust and understand automated decisions, bridging the gap between automation and user control.

By building a rule-based explanation system, this project aims to enhance user understanding, reduce debugging time, and promote best practices in writing distributed SQL queries. This work not only improves efficiency and resource utilization but also contributes to the larger goal of explainable and human-centric AI in data systems.

# Problem Statement

As SQL-based distributed systems like Apache Spark and Hive continue to power large-scale data processing, writing performant queries has become both crucial and increasingly complex. While these systems offer advanced query optimization features, users often struggle to understand why a query is slow, inefficient, or resource-heavy. Execution plans generated by the engines are detailed but not intuitive, especially for those without deep systems-level knowledge.

Current tools provide performance metrics or raw execution plans, but they lack clear, actionable explanations in natural language. As a result, users are left to manually interpret complex technical outputs or rely on trial-and-error to improve performance. Moreover, AI-based solutions like ChatGPT can generate general SQL advice, but they lack deep integration with distributed query execution contexts and are not tailored to specific system rules or execution environments.

This creates a pressing need for a transparent, rule-driven system that can analyze SQL queries and execution plans and generate understandable explanations and suggestions. The system should work directly within distributed SQL environments, automatically detecting common inefficiencies—such as full table scans, expensive joins, or unfiltered data movement—and offering natural language feedback grounded in domain knowledge.

Without such a solution, users risk writing inefficient queries that consume excessive time and resources, impacting system performance, increasing costs, and reducing productivity.

# Objectives


The primary objective of this research is to design and implement a rule-based natural language explanation system for SQL queries executed on distributed systems, particularly using Apache Hive and Apache Spark. This project aims to bridge the gap between complex query execution plans and user understanding by generating intuitive natural language explanations and visualizing inferred query costs, even when such information is not directly available in system outputs.

Specific Objectives:
1. Extract and Interpret Execution Plans from Apache Hive
Parse Hive’s execution plans, which typically lack direct cost metrics, and convert them into a structured format suitable for explanation.

2. Leverage Apache Spark for Distributed Computation
Utilize Apache Spark's master and worker nodes to efficiently process large-scale queries and simulate distributed environments for performance profiling.

3. Develop a Rule-Based Explanation Engine
Implement a comprehensive rule system that maps patterns in the execution plan (e.g., full table scans, shuffle joins) to human-readable insights and potential performance concerns.

4. Generate Natural Language Explanations
Translate low-level operations into clear, user-friendly language, helping developers and analysts quickly understand system behavior.

5. Infer and Visualize Query Cost
Since Hive does not explicitly expose query cost, use rule-based heuristics (e.g., size of data scanned, number of partitions, join types) to approximate the cost and visualize it using intuitive charts and indicators.

6. Provide Actionable Optimization Suggestions
Suggest concrete tuning actions (e.g., filtering strategies, partitioning, changing join orders) based on detected inefficiencies.

7. Build an Interactive and Modular Interface
Allow users to input queries and receive explanations and visualizations in real time through an API or graphical interface.

8. Evaluate Performance and Explainability
Assess how well the system supports users in understanding and optimizing their SQL queries across various Hive and Spark-based workloads.

# System Architecture

The architecture of the proposed system is designed to provide a fast, scalable, and explainable SQL query processing environment by leveraging modern distributed computing frameworks and a user-friendly interface. The system integrates Apache Spark, Hive, Hadoop HDFS, and Streamlit, orchestrated through a containerized environment for modularity and scalability.

 Core Components:
1. User Interface (Streamlit + JupyterLab)

Users interact with the system through a Streamlit web application that includes a SQL editor.

After entering a query, users receive:

The original execution plan from Hive,

A natural language explanation of the plan (via rule-based reasoning),

Suggestions for query optimization,

A visual cost indicator that scales the estimated query expense.

2. Query Processing Layer (Hive + Spark)

Apache Hive is used as the query engine, backed by a PostgreSQL-based Hive Metastore to store metadata about tables and schemas.

Each query submitted by the user is parsed and executed through Apache Spark, enabling:

Distributed query execution across two Spark worker nodes,

Concurrency and high throughput, even under multiple user queries.

3. Data Storage Layer (Hadoop HDFS)

The system reads and writes data using Hadoop HDFS, which consists of:

One NameNode and two DataNodes,

Ensures fault-tolerant, scalable storage and parallel read/write operations.

Hive tables are stored on HDFS and accessed using Hive’s native format.

4. Execution Plan & Rule Engine

After Hive generates an execution plan, the system extracts the steps and processes them using a custom rule-based engine.

This engine interprets:

Join strategies (e.g., broadcast join, shuffle join),

Scan types (e.g., full scan, partition scan),

Sorting, filtering, and shuffling operations.

Based on these patterns, natural language explanations and optimization suggestions are generated.

5. Query Cost Visualization Module

Although Hive execution plans do not expose query cost explicitly, the system uses rule-based heuristics to infer query complexity.

A visual scale (e.g., Low/Medium/High cost) is presented to the user using Streamlit’s charting tools.

Factors influencing cost include data scanned, partitioning, type of joins, and number of shuffle operations.

6. Connection & Execution Pipeline

A seamless connection pipeline links:

Streamlit → Hive → Spark → HDFS, ensuring efficient data access and job execution.

For each query, a dedicated Spark job is submitted, ensuring:

Concurrent user handling,

Reduced response time due to parallel processing.

This modular, distributed architecture ensures that end-users benefit from the speed of Spark, the structure of Hive, and the clarity of natural language explanations, all while maintaining system scalability and performance. By integrating query reasoning and visual analytics into a single workflow, the platform provides a novel way of making distributed SQL query execution understandable and actionable.
